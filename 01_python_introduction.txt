what is python?
-> python is a dynamically passed, general purpose programming language that supports an
object oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
Python is an interpreted and high level programming language.
It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.


Features of Python->
Python is simple and easy to understand.
It is interpreted and platform independent which makes debugging very easy.
It is an open source programming language.
Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include Numpy, TensorFlow, Selerium, OpenCV etc.
It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.


What is python used for ->
Python is used for data visualisation to create plots and graphical representations.
Python helps in data analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
It is used to craete web applications.
It can be used to handle databases.
It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.


There are two versions of Python
1. python 2.x -> very old version, not using
2. Python 3.x -> new version, 3.7, 3.8 3.10 etc we will usually use to run code

Use of python code in data industry
1. Data Science -> ML(Scikit Learn), DL(Pytorch, TensorFlow), CV(MxNET, ONGNX, OpenCV), NLP(NLTK, Stanford NLP), RL(Pytorch, Tensorflow)

why we use python?
-> It is the easiest language just like writing english liturature.
-> But is is little bit slower, it depends on the machine processor which is used.


where python is used?
-> Gaming Industry
-> Robotics Industry
-> Application Building -> GUI 
-> Automation Industry 
-> All kind of file handling
-> It gives the flexibility to connect to all kind of databases
